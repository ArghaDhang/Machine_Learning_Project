# Machine_Learning_Project
#Diabetes_Prediction_Model
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on key health indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin, age, and blood pressure. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and prevention using data-driven techniques.

🎯 Objective

To develop an accurate and reliable model that can classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using supervised learning algorithms.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Database, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome):

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

Outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)


🧠 Algorithms Used

Several algorithms were trained and compared for accuracy and performance:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


⚙ Technologies

Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code


🔍 Steps Involved

1. Data Loading and Exploration


2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning


3. Feature Selection and Scaling


4. Model Training and Evaluation


5. Accuracy Comparison
